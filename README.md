# LMI-Capstone
Data + Resources for the Multimodal RAG in Education Capstone Project


## Contents:
This repository contains content pulled from weeks 7-9 of DS3001. The content from other weeks will need to be pulled from [Canvas](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/71695) and the [course repo](https://github.com/UVADS/DS-3001/tree/main). The documents incldued are the raw documents and will need to be reformatted to be chunked and vectorized.

### pdf_books folder: 
.pdf files of textbooks we have found to be relevant and high quality resources

### lecture_transcripts folder: 
.txt files of the automatically generated transcripts from Professor Wright's weekly lecture videos

### lectures folder: 
.pdf/.ppt files of lecture slides

## RAG resources:
- [LangChain videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfaIDFEXuae2LXbO1_PKyVJiQ23ZztA0x&si=zyGems8IRQYZwmU1) A good overview to get an idea of the big picture & different parts of RAG 

- [RAG paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401) The original publication 

- [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/advanced_rag#load-your-knowledge-base) Another good walkthrough of a RAG architecture with examples and plainly written commentary 

- [RAG with LangChain tutorial book](https://www.sakunaharinda.xyz/ragatouille-book/1_Intro.html) Another great tutorial with code + explanations for implementing RAG 

- [RAG vs Fine tuning](https://medium.com/@bijit211987/when-to-apply-rag-vs-fine-tuning-90a34e7d6d25#:~:text=Dynamic%20RAG%20vs%20static%20fine,evolve%20fine-tuned%20models%20online) A nice comparison between RAG and fine-tuning, helpful to understand why RAG may be a better solution than fine-tuning for some applications.
